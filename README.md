## Design

### Colour Scheme

For the colours I based them off the colours of the stone used at Göbekli Tepe, a type of Tan. I then chose a suitable dark complimentary colour - Dark Navy.
![ScreenShot](documentation/documentation-images/göbekli-tepe-colour-scheme.png)

This then gave me two options of how I could implement these colours on the site. In the end I went with Option 2 as this felt more modern and looked better.
|                       **Colour Option 1**                               |                           **Colour Option 2**                                  |
  | :----------------------------------------------------------:        | :-------------------------------------------------------------------:        |
  | ![ScreenShot](documentation/documentation-images/colour-option-1.png)  | ![ScreenShot](documentation/documentation-images/colour-option-2.png)     |


[ *all colors are set at `:root` level in CSS* ]

- `#161C21` (*Navy*)
- `#d6b68e` (*Tan*)


### Typography

I have tried to use old antique style font's, due to it being an ancient site. I found the Dalek font from doctor who, which really gave the logo an old style look to it. I then chose Inknut Antiqua as this is a more modern font for readability with an old style twist to keep in in keeping with the site.
My preference for fallback font is Arial & Serif.

The Dalek font is a custom font, which I got from dafont.
Inknut Antiqua is a google font.

* [Dalek](https://www.dafont.com/dalek.font) is used for the logo, headers and Welcome messages on the page.
* [Inknut Antiqua ](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inknut+Antiqua) is used for the most of the body text on the page.

|                       **Dalek Font**                               |                           **Inknut Antiqua Font**                                  |
  | :----------------------------------------------------------:        | :-------------------------------------------------------------------:        |
  | ![ScreenShot](documentation/documentation-images/dalek-font.png)  | ![ScreenShot](documentation/documentation-images/inknut-antiqua-font.png)     |


### Imagery 
I have used different sources for images and to create the logo and favicon, all free to use or with owners consent.
Please see [Credits](#credits) section for more info.


### Symbols
Symbols were created using Illustrator and are based on the symbols found within Göbekli Tepe on its various pillars and other areas where symbols have been depicted in reliefs.
![Adobe Illustrator](https://img.shields.io/badge/adobe%20illustrator-%23FF9A00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=adobe%20illustrator&logoColor=white)
 |           **Icon 1**          |           **Icon 2**          |           **Icon 3**          |           **Icon 4**          |
 | :---------------------------: | :---------------------------: | :---------------------------: | :---------------------------: |
 | ![Icon 1](assets/images/timeline-icons/Info_Box_1-symbol.svg)  | ![Icon 2](assets/images/timeline-icons/Info_Box_2-symbol.svg) | ![Icon 3](assets/images/timeline-icons/Info_Box_5-symbol.svg) | ![Icon 4](assets/images/timeline-icons/Info_Box_6-symbol.svg) |
I used these on both the Gallery & Timeline pages.

#### Logo

When creating the logo I wanted to create a logo that would be easily associated with Göbekli Tepe. I used the Dalek font for this. I then used one of it's pillars to replace the "T" character from the text. I based the symbol off "Pillar 18" and re-created it within Illustrator.
I also used this symbol to create the site favicon.

 |                       **Logo**                               |                           **Favicon**                                  |
  | :----------------------------------------------------------:        | :-------------------------------------------------------------------:        |
  | ![Logo](assets/images/logo.svg)  | ![Favicon](assets/favicon/favicon.png)     |

  * To create the logo and Favicon I have used Adobe Illustrator:
 [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/illustrator.html) ![Adobe Illustrator](https://img.shields.io/badge/adobe%20illustrator-%23FF9A00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=adobe%20illustrator&logoColor=white)

 * For the hero image please see reference in credits, I then edited it within Photoshop:

* For the Nav Button and View More button the symbols were created within Illustrator

 |                       **Nav Button**                               |                           **View More Button**                                  |

### Wireframes

I have usedAdobe XD software to create my wireframes, for desktop and mobile.
The finished product came very close to the initial concepts.
