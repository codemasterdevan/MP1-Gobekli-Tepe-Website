                    <p>Göbekli Tepe was first identified as a potential archaeological site in the 1960s but was not fully excavated until the 1990s. German archaeologist Klaus Schmidt began working on the site in 1996 and quickly realized that the structures at Göbekli Tepe were unlike anything ever seen before. The site has since been extensively studied, revealing a complex of megaliths and stones carefully arranged to form circular structures.

It is now believed that the construction of such complex structures predates the advent of agriculture and the rise of civilization, which suggests that early human societies were capable of complex organization and cooperation long before the development of cities and states.
